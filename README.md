# MVP: 
1) Users will first create a user account with the web application or log into their exisiting account:
  These are the fields they are required to fill out(when they first create an account):
    * Name 
    * Email
    * Major/year 
    * City 
    * What are you looking for? Internship/full-time
2) Then, user uploads their resume to the web app (.pdf files only) 
3) After the user uploads their resume, he/she can upvote, downvote or comment (comments can be upvoted or downvoted) on other users'      resumes.  
4) Users will get notified whenever someone comments/upvote & downvote their resume
